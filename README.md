# Test your skills frontend-challenge:

Challenge I did for the 'Women in Tech'-course, as the last assignment for the frontend module of the course.

The original challenge had a deadline of 12 hours, from the first commit until the last.

## Challenge:

-   The assignment was to recreate the given Figma design into a functioning webpage.
-   To get as many of the criterias as possible.

## Teacher's Criteras:

-   1. Valid HTML/CSS(no errors, warnings, etc)
-   2. Semantic markup(nav, navigation as list, section for sections, etc)
-   3. Everything should look like the design(fonts, colors, background, borders, etc). The only exceptions are large margins, paddings, and position. These are not allowed.
-   4. Use normalize.css or reset.css
-   5. Use Google Fonts and Font Awesome(if a font is not available for free, find the most similar free option)
-   6. All interactive elements such as buttons and links need to have hover and focus styling
-   7. Add a favicon to the website
-   8. Use Sass
-   9. Make sure the website is croww browser compatible by checking it in Chrome and Firefox. It should look similar/the same in both browsers
-   10. The page should be fully responsive down to 320px
-   11. The form should have validations
-   12. Completeness: It is better to aim for all the sections to be done but not perfect, instead of having only one section done perfectly. However, it is better to have one section donw ell than to have all sections be a complete mess. You need to find a balance between completeness and perfection.
